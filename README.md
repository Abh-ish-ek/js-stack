# js-stack

The purpose of this library is to implement the stack functionallity using Java Script.
Currently it has two functions Push and Pop.
Push(x): Used to Insert the data
Pop(x): Used to delete the data
x: x can be any number, string or variable which needs to be Push or Pop

Example:
To Push or Pop the data we directly use as:
var stckObj= require('js-stack');
stackObj.Push(5);
stackObj.Push('User');
stackObj.Pop();
